 1) Book a room — ability to add a new reservation with guest name, dates, and room number.
2) Check-room availability — show which rooms are free or already booked for given dates.
3) Check-in a guest — mark a booking as “checked in,” assign the room to the guest.
4) Check-out a guest — mark departure, free up the room.
 5) Store guest basic info — at least name and contact. (Optionally also stay dates.)
  6) Store room info — room number/ID, maybe type (single/double), and status (free / occupied).
  7) Cancel a booking — allow removing or changing a reservation before check-in, and free the room.
 8) Simple billing / charges tracking — record room charges and maybe extra charges; show total due on check-out.
 9) List current bookings / guests / free rooms — ability to view a summary: who’s staying, which rooms are free, upcoming bookings.4
 10) Persist data between runs — store all bookings, rooms, guest info, payments in a file or database so that closing the CLI program doesn’t lose everything.
